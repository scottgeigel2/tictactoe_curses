coord needs to be pushed or something so meta board gets marked after meta inner game finishes

what happens if a meta inner game draws?

add a backspace to send the player back to the meta board (if a legal move)
perhaps make the character press a key to view the meta inner board with their move before
progressing to the meta board

draw a cool border around the status messages?
maybe a heading/title bar?
